    <h1>Crustless Spinach Quiche</h1>
    <img src="https://www.thatskinnychickcanbake.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Crustless-Spinach-Quiche.jpg" alt="">
    <p>This crustless quiche made with eggs, spinach, and Muenster cheese is perfect to serve at any meal. With no heavy crust to make, this light-tasting quiche is ready in under an hour. Make it your own by adding leftover ham and substituting Cheddar, feta, or goat cheese for the Muenster. I serve this quick and easy quiche in the summer for brunch with a side of sausage links and a fresh fruit bowl!</p>
